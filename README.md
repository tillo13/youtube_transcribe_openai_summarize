# Youtube Transcribe, Metadata Extractor, and OpenAI Integration

This project is implemented with the assistance of **GitHub Copilot**, a next-generation AI programming assistant developed by GitHub and OpenAI. GitHub Copilot provides contextual code completions, making the code development process more efficient.

## Overview

The YouTube Transcribe and Metadata Extractor is a powerful tool that not only extracts transcripts and metadata from a YouTube video but now also connects with the OpenAI API to generate informative summaries of the extracted content. Using the [youtube_transcript_api](https://pypi.org/project/youtube-transcript-api/) and the OpenAI API, this script gets a video's transcript, extracts additional metadata, and utilizes OpenAI-based summarization for text generated from video content.

## Key Features

This project incorporates key features both from the core application and the added OpenAI functionality:

- **Extract Video ID**: The unique video ID from the YouTube URL is extracted for use in fetching transcripts and associated metadata.

- **Fetch Transcript and Timestamps**: The entire transcript of the YouTube video is retrieved, along with timestamps, for precise navigation within video segments.

- **Metadata Extraction**: Information such as the transcript language, language code, transcriber (human or auto-generated), and translatability are fetched and made available in readable form.

- **Translation Capability Check**: The system verifies if the transcript can be translated to Spanish and Japanese languages.

- **Integration with OpenAI**: The newly added script, `openai_utils.py`, leverages OpenAI's innovative GPT-3 model to process the transcribed text. The integration allows for AI-backed transcript cleaning, grammar correction, readability enhancement, and intelligent summary generation. 

## Future Enhancements

1. **Improved Text Parsing and Cleaning**: Enhance the OpenAI-powered text cleaning for better grammar and higher readability scores.

2. **Section Timestamps Display**: Utilize the timestamp data to show a structured breakdown of the video contents for easy navigation.

3. **Automatic Language Translation**: Implement translation of the transcript to other languages based on user preference.

4. **Advanced Summary Generation**: Integrate more powerful OpenAI summarization capabilities to generate briefer and more pointed summaries of video content.

5. **Sentiment Analysis**: Use OpenAI to conduct sentiment analysis on the video's transcript for better user content strategy.

6. **Keyword Extraction**: Parse the transcript to identify and highlight keywords and phrases, providing a quick overview of video content.

7. **Speaker Identification**: Improve the system to recognize different speakers in the video.

8. **Collaborative Transcript Corrections**: Allow users to manually correct automated transcripts for an enhanced and refined transcript experience.

9. **Extended Platform Integration**: Extend the functionality of the tool to other platforms, such as podcasts or lecturing platforms.

10. **Timestamp-based Comments/Notes**: Enable users to attach comments or notes to specific timestamps in the transcript.
