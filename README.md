# Youtube Transcribe and Metadata Extractor

This project is implemented with **GitHub Copilot**, a cutting-edge AI tool developed by GitHub and OpenAI. GitHub Copilot acts as an AI pair programmer, assisting in writing code and introducing new features. It provides code suggestions and completions that are contextually appropriate, making the coding process faster and more efficient.

## Overview

The YouTube Transcribe and Metadata Extractor can extract transcripts and other useful metadata from a YouTube video. The script uses the [youtube_transcript_api](https://pypi.org/project/youtube-transcript-api/) to fetch the video's transcript and additional metadata information, such as the transcript's language, whether the transcript was generated automatically, and if it is translatable to other languages.

## Key Features

This project incorporates features enabled by GitHub Copilot:

- **Extract Video ID**: The script extracts the unique video ID from the YouTube video URL. This ID is used to fetch the transcript and metadata for the video.

- **Fetch Transcript and Timestamps**: The script retrieves the entire transcript of the YouTube video, along with the timestamps. This feature allows for precise navigation and direct access to specific video segments.

- **Metadata Extraction**: This feature fetches metadata like the language of the transcript, the language code, whether the transcript was auto-generated, and if it is translatable.

- **Translation Capability Check**: The script checks if the extracted transcript is translatable to Spanish and Japanese languages.

## Future Enhancements

1. **OpenAI Text Parsing and Cleaning**: Use AI models from OpenAI for transcript cleaning, grammar correction, and improving readability.

2. **Section Timestamps Display**: Use the timestamp data obtained from the transcript to show a structured breakdown of the video content. This would allow viewers to navigate to different sections of the video easily.

3. **Language Translation**: Implement automatic translation of the transcript into the user's preferred language.

4. **Summary Generation**: Use OpenAI's summarization capabilities to generate a brief summary of the video content.

5. **Sentiment Analysis**: Conduct sentiment analysis on the video's transcript to identify the general sentiment towards the content.

6. **Keyword Extraction**: Develop a function to identify and extract keywords and key phrases from the transcript, providing a quick overview of the video content.

7. **Speaker Identification**: Enhance the system to identify different speakers in the video and assign lines to them in the transcript.

8. **Automated Transcription Corrections**: Enable users to correct automated transcripts, increasing the usefulness of the generated transcript.

9. **Integration with Other Platforms**: Extend functionality to other platforms such as podcasts or lecture platforms.

10. **Timestamp-Linked Comments or Notes**: Provide a function for users to attach comments or notes to specific timestamps in the transcript, useful for future analysis or reviews.
