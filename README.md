# Youtube Transcribe and Metadata Extractor

The project is built with **GitHub Copilot**, a cloud-based artificial intelligence tool developed by GitHub and OpenAI. GitHub Copilot works as an AI pair programmer that aids in writing code and adding features. It provides context-appropriate code prediction and completion suggestions, making the coding process faster and more efficient.

## Overview

The YouTube Transcribe and Metadata Extractor is capable of extracting transcript and other useful metadata from a YouTube video. The script makes use of [youtube_transcript_api](https://pypi.org/project/youtube-transcript-api/) to fetch the transcript of the video, along with additional metadata information like the language of the transcript, whether it was automatically generated or not, and whether it can be translated to other languages.

## Key Features

Here are some features that have been implemented into this project with the aid of GitHub Copilot:

- **Extract video ID**: The script extracts the video ID using the URL of the video. This video ID is then used to extract the transcript and metadata.

- **Fetch transcript and timestamps**: Fetches the entire transcript of the YouTube video. This includes the time at which each section starts and ends, allowing for precise navigation and direct access to specific sections of the video.

- **Metadata extraction**: Retrieves various metadata such as language, language code, transcript autogenerated flag, and translatable flag.

- **Translation capabilities**: Checks whether the extracted transcript is translatable to Spanish and Japanese languages.

## Future Ideas

1. **Use OpenAI to parse and clean up the text**: Use advanced AI models provided by OpenAI to remove any inconsistencies in the transcript, perform grammatical corrections, and enhance readability.

2. **Show timestamps of sections**: Using the timestamps data obtained from the transcript, display a structured outline of various pieces in the video. Users can use this outline to navigate through different parts of the video directly.

3. **Language translation**: Implement a text translator that automatically translates the transcript into the user's preferred language.

4. **Summary Generator**: Use OpenAI's summarization capabilities to provide a brief summary of the video content.

5. **Sentiment Analysis**: Incorporate a sentiment analysis feature that identifies the overall sentiment of the video based on the transcript.

6. **Keyword extraction**: Develop a system that extracts key phrases and topics from the transcript for a quick overview.

7. **Speaker Identification**: Upgrade the system to identify different speakers in a video and attribute lines to them in the transcript.

8. **Automated transcription corrections**: Implement a feature that enables users to make corrections to the automated transcripts, improving the utility of the transcript.

9. **Integration with other platforms**: Build integrations for the code to function with other platforms like podcasts or lecture platforms.

10. **Timestamp-linked comments or notes**: Add a feature for users to add comments or notes linked to specific timestamps in the transcripts. This can be very useful for analyzing or reviewing the videos later.
